  abstract: "What constitutes a failure when working with interactions between robots and humans? Can we safely assume that humans do not fail when interacting with each other, and can we demand the same from our robotic systems? With this talk, we will explore the role of failures in human-robot interaction, focusing on demystifying the negative preconception surrounding them. By looking at research from the Interaction Design field, we will differentiate between slips and mistakes, map them to robot errors, and discuss how they can drive the interaction. Owning up to a failure could have consequences on the overall rapport between humans and robots. It has the potential to influence trust and provide a valid method to reshape the expectations that naive users have about the technology, which could ultimately downsize the severity of the failure."

  bio: "Explainable plan execution monitoring under partial observability"
  abstract: "Successful plan generation for autonomous systems is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee reaching a goal state by an execution of a plan. Various discrepancies between an expected state and the observed state may occur during the plan execution (e.g., due to unexpected exogenous events, changes in the goals, or failure of robot parts) and these discrepancies may lead to plan failures. For that reason, autonomous systems should be equipped with execution monitoring algorithms so that they can autonomously recover from such discrepancies. We introduce a plan execution monitoring algorithm that operates under partial observability. This algorithm relies on novel formal methods for hybrid prediction, diagnosis and explanation generation, and planning. The prediction module generates an expected state after the execution of a part of the plan from an incomplete state to check for discrepancies. The diagnostic reasoning module generates meaningful hypotheses to explain failures of robot parts. Unlike the existing diagnosis methods, the previous hypotheses can be revised, based on new partial observations, increasing the accuracy of explanations as further information becomes available. The replanning module considers these explanations while computing a new plan that would avoid such failures. All these reasoning modules are hybrid in that they combine high-level logical reasoning with low-level feasibility checks based on probabilistic methods. We experimentally show that these hybrid formal reasoning modules improve the performance of plan execution monitoring."
