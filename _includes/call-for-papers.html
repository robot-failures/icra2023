                        <h4>Submission guidelines</h4>

                        Submissions to the workshop can be either short papers (4 pages) or conference-length papers (6 pages). Submissions describing work in progress that authors would like to discuss with the workshop participants are encouraged and welcome. The workshop does not have official proceedings, but the submitted papers will be posted on the workshop website if the authors agree.
                        <br/><br />

                        Each submitted paper will receive at least two reviews, based on which an acceptance decision will be made. Papers should be submitted via EasyChair. Please note that email submissions will not be accepted.
